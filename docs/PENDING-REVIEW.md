# Pending review

Design topics the user has asked to revisit later. Each entry says what was
decided for now and why it stays open. Add new items rather than deciding them
silently.

| Topic | Current decision | Revisit because | Since |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Immutable strings | Strings are immutable and bump-allocated on the request data stack. Building a page copies pieces into joins. | Copy volume for large pages. Alternatives: last-use in-place append, or part lists written straight to the socket ([RESPONSE-STREAMING.md](RESPONSE-STREAMING.md)). | 2026-10-13 |
| Workflow ceremony | A word must have a passing attached test before commit, and Flow code goes through define, commit and test. | Feels heavy when iterating on UI templates. Kept for now; review against agent authoring experience. | 2026-10-13 |
| Shared response cache | Not implemented. Caching is disabled in all benchmark servers. | A cross-worker cache is a new cross-thread dependency. Discuss it before adopting ([RESPONSE-STREAMING.md](RESPONSE-STREAMING.md#cached-parts)). | 2026-10-13 |
